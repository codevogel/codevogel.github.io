## What is Detective Duck?

<span class="text-primary">Detective Duck</span> is a 'whodunit' game that
experiments with real-time dialogue generation using ChatGPT for educational
applied games. The game is designed for
<a href="https://www.ranj.com/">&Ranj</a>, a Dutch game studio that specializes
in creating serious games. It is the result of my graduation thesis for the
Bachelor of Science in Game Development at the Amsterdam University of Applied
Sciences.

Continuing on this work, I wrote a paper titled

> Designing Meaningful AI-Generated Dialogue: The Behaviour-Driven Conditional
> Prompting Framework for Serious Games

which was published to and presented at the
[European Conference on Games Based Learning (ECGBL) 2025)](https://www.academic-conferences.org/conferences/ecgbl/)
in Levanger, Norway.

The paper can be read
