## What is Robotlab VR?

**_Robotlab VR_** was the first big VR project I worked on. At the Amsterdam
University of Applied Sciences' esteemed Robot Lab, we recognized the potential
dangers associated with working directly with robotic arms. To address these
concerns, we set out to create a tool that would allow students to practice and
refine their skills in a risk-free virtual setting.

## The goal

The Robot Lab was coping with a limited availability of physical robots for
training purposes, and the potential for damage caused to those robots by
improper handling. With this in mind, we developed a serious game that provides
students with a safe and immersive training experience. The game allows learners
to navigate through various scenarios, honing their ability to control and
manipulate robotic arms before they ever step foot into a real-world laboratory.
They familiarize themselves with the usage of the Flexpendant - a controller
designed specifically to control such robots.

By simulating real-life situations, students can experiment, learn, and grow
without the fear of physical repercussions.

## My contributions

I made a realistic model of the Flexpendant, and mapped the buttons and
joysticks so that the user experience is as close to the real thing as possible.
I implemented the physics of the robotic arm, and programmed a few of the
mini-games that students can play to practice their skills.

I also oversaw the art direction for this project, and composed some atmospheric
music for this project, enhancing the immersive experience. The aim was to
foster an ambiance that amplifies students' concentration and focus during their
virtual training sessions.
