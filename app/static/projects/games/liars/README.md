# Liars!

**_Liars!_** is a physical card game about deception and deduction.

It is a game that is designed for >= 3 players.

The game is about little known, yet true facts.

In this game, there is one deductor. The other players secretly get assigned a
role:

- Truth-teller: Tells the truth about this fact.
- Liar: Have no idea about the fact, and must make up a believable story.

The deductor must figure out who is telling the truth, and who is lying.

The game is currently in development, and will be available soon!
