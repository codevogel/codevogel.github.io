# Ouija.TV

## What is Ouija.TV?

**_Ouija.TV_** is an online multiplayer version of the classic board game. You
could create a lobby, share it with your friends, and let them answer your
questions as spirits!

It includes Twitch.TV chat integration, allowing streamers to play the game with
their viewers.

## Can I play it?

Unfortunately, due to server costs, we had to shut it down. (for now)

If you're still interested in this project and would like to see it back online,
please contact me through [my Contact page](/contact)!
