## What is Reggie?

**_"Reggie, his cousin, two scientists and most likely the end of the world”_**
is an adventure about time travel and its consequences. Its rich, quirky, plot
involves a grumpy scientist from the sixteenth century, black holes, time
travel, dinosaurs, a gnome University, alternative dark dimensions and an
unexpected final villain who likes the universe without science better. Humour
is a constant and frequent plot twists keep the player guessing about what will
happen next!
